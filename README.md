This is a simple Juce project to test Juce 8 Direct2D rendering speeds.
There are two pre-compiled binaries, one has been compiled using the last develop of JUCE 7.12, the other has been compiled using Matt Gonzalez' JUCE 8.06 fork with some improvements regarding DropShadow.

This test creates a "smoke" animation based mainly on the DropShadow class.
